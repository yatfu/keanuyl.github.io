Forever is an electronic-dance-music (EDM) track that I made during my leisure time. The purpose of this project was to learn and understand the fundamentals of EDM and pop music. These fundamentals included, but aren't limited to: basic chord theory, beat-making, bass-treble balance, vocal editing, and composition. I chose Illenium to base this track on because I listen to a lot of his music and he is my favorite future bass artist. I also wanted to focus more on honing my technical skills for this project than my creativity, given that this was my first time using the software, FL Studio.
 
FL Studio is an audio editor used by many professionals to produce songs, transform audio clips, and create soundscapes. My project only used a few of the tools it had to offer, which included synthesizers, beat makers, equalizers, effects, and mixers.

I also used an audio sample site, called Splice, to gather sounds of drums, piano, guitar, and vocals.

This project was a very good exercise which helped me get more comfortable with the software. I learned how to be more efficient when producing sounds, and am able to be more creative with other projects following this one.
