<h1>What is Octo-Screen?</h1>

OctoScreen is an online tool that allows users to keep track of their COVID-19 status through a check-in based system. Users can log in, check in by taking the sympmtoms questionaire, and then view their status along with all their previous check-ins. In addition, users can upload and view their vaccination card information, along with a picture of their vaccination card.

This project reminded me of how important skills such as communication and teamwork are. Throughout the project I mainly worked on the Vaccination Status page. 

My experience working on this project with my team members was definitely a learning experience, as I learned a lot from my shortcomings in this project. One of the main issues I personally faced was coordinating with the rest of my group members, as I often found our work overlapping with each other. This in addition to failing to effectively communicate with my team members resulted in me scrapping a lot of my contributions because they were already implemented. I look to improve on these aspects going into the next projects with my team.
