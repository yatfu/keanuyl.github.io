## Building a Website is NOT easy.
A couple weeks ago, my classmates and I started learning HTML and CSS. We learned to do things like change styles, create links to other sites, and subdivide blocks of text into columns. The thing that I struggled most with was the stylesheet, a CSS file that controls the theme of your website. There were so many tools, and knowing which one to use for the look I wanted was the hardest part. However, once I got accustomed to the tools, the task of creating something that looks like what I had in mind became a whole lot easier. 
## Jumping into Semantic UI

Semantic UI basically does the hard work for you. It gives you classes and IDs so you don't have to implement them yourself. At first, I thought that giving us all the tools we need would somehow dampen our flexibility, but it actually allows for more creativity. Using a UI framework allows the someone to freely design a website without worrying about the implementation, since its already implemented.
## Conclusions
My experiences with HTML, CSS,and Semantic UI has made me really excited, as its really fun. I think this is an extremely useful skill that I can use for myself and for others, and will undoubtedly be something I will delve further into. I'm very excited to learn React and the other frameworks available.
