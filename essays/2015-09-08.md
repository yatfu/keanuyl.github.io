Coming into this class with no prior experience with JavaScript, my first impressions of JavaScript were that it was very similar to, but simpler than my first programming language, Java. This impression was mainly the result of JavaScript having dynamic variables, where Java only uses static ones. It's easy to see why this would make JavaScript simpler, since you don't have to declare the variable type. 

However, it is hard to tell any real differences at the moment, since we haven't actually done anything with the language yet. I know that JavaScript is used a lot in web applications, but don't understand why. I'm eager to learn more about it in the coming weeks.

The ES6 features seemed completely different, even though I knew they were also a part of JavaScript. I'm excited to use some of the new tools, such as the deconstructor, in my future projects, as they all seem really useful.
