Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
Problem: Buying and selling books from the bookstore is tedious
Solution: Our website, the UHM Textbook Market, will allow students to login, browse textbooks posted by other students, and
advertise their books on the site. The profile can include contact information.

When a user creates a profile, they will be able to browse and advertise textbooks on the site. 

Admins can review negative reports and give punishments as needed, they can also review reports 

Mockup page ideas:
  Landing page
  User home page
  Admin home page
  User profile page
  Browse page

Use case ideas
New user goes to landing page, logs in, is redirected to home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
Buying User goes to landing page, logs in, goes to browse page, chooses an advertisement, contacts seller.
Selling User goes to landing page, logs in, goes to user profile page, creates an advertisement.
  Note: Buying and selling can be done on the same account.
  
Beyond the basics
  Search bar, sorting advertisements based on subjects/classes, user rating, scammer report system
